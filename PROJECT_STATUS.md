# Project Status - Abstract Image Generator

**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025
**Current Phase:** MVP Complete - Enhanced with Paragraph-Based Shapes

## Project Vision

Create a tool that generates abstract images from blog post content for social media sharing. The user is a reasonably experienced developer who publishes content on their blog, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and needs an automated way to create accompanying images.

## What's Been Completed

### Phase 1: Core Engine ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Content analyzer module (`src/contentAnalyzer.js`)
  - Cleans HTML and extracts plain text
  - Calculates metrics: word count, character count, average word length, reading time, **paragraph count**
  - Counts paragraphs from HTML `<p>` tags or double line breaks
  - Creates content hash for deterministic seeding

- ‚úÖ Seed generator module (`src/seedGenerator.js`)
  - Generates deterministic seed from content metrics
  - Maps metrics to visual parameters (density, complexity, smoothness, layers, **shapeVertices**, paletteIndex)
  - **NEW:** Paragraph count ‚Üí shape vertices (3-20 edges per polygon)

- ‚úÖ Visual generator module (`src/visualGenerator.js`)
  - p5.js-based generative art engine
  - Organic/flowing style using Perlin noise and bezier curves
  - 10 curated color palettes
  - Gradient backgrounds
  - Layered composition with alpha transparency
  - Subtle noise texture overlay
  - **NEW:** Shapes use paragraph-based vertex count (more paragraphs = more complex polygons)
  - **NEW:** Flowing curves start from top of image and cascade downward

### Phase 2: Web Interface ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ HTML interface (`index.html`)
  - Textarea for pasting content
  - File upload for HTML/TXT files
  - Toggle between paste and upload modes

- ‚úÖ Styling (`styles.css`)
  - Modern, clean design
  - Gradient header
  - Responsive layout
  - Preview grid for multiple formats

### Phase 3: Integration ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Main application logic (`src/app.js`)
  - Orchestrates content analysis ‚Üí seed generation ‚Üí visual generation
  - Handles UI interactions
  - Manages p5.js sketch lifecycle

### Phase 4: Multi-format Output ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Landscape format (1200√ó628px) - optimal for Twitter/LinkedIn/Blog
- ‚úÖ Square format (1200√ó1200px) - optimal for Instagram/general use
- ‚úÖ **FIXED:** Images now generated from single master (1200√ó1200) and cropped, preventing stretching

### Phase 5: Download Functionality ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ One-click download for each format
- ‚úÖ Automatic filename generation from content

### Documentation ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ README.md - User-facing documentation
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md - Developer/AI assistant guidance
- ‚úÖ .gitignore - Project hygiene
- ‚úÖ package.json with npm start script

### Setup ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed (http-server)
- ‚úÖ Project structure established

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Technology Choice:** JavaScript/Node.js with p5.js (over .NET)
   - Rationale: Web-friendly, great generative art ecosystem, easier prototyping

2. **Visual Style:** Organic/flowing (over geometric or data-viz)
   - Uses Perlin noise, bezier curves, gradients
   - Natural, artistic aesthetic

3. **Determinism:** Same content always produces same image
   - Uses seeded random and noise functions
   - Critical for branding consistency

4. **Interface:** Web-based with paste/upload (not CLI initially)
   - More visual, easier to preview
   - CLI can be added later for automation

5. **Workflow:** Fully automated generation (no manual tweaking)
   - One-click from content to image
   - Manual controls could be added in v2

6. **Content Analysis:** Simple metrics for v1
   - Word count, character count, average word length, reading time, **paragraph count**
   - Paragraph count determines shape complexity (3-20 vertices)
   - Semantic/NLP analysis planned for v2

7. **Multi-format Generation:** Master image + crop approach (not separate renders)
   - Generate one master canvas at maximum size (1200√ó1200)
   - Crop from top-left to create different formats
   - Prevents stretching/distortion of visual elements
   - Ensures consistent composition across formats

8. **Visual Flow:** Curves cascade from top of image
   - Flowing lines start at top (y=0) and extend downward
   - Different curves reach different depths based on noise
   - Creates a cascading, waterfall-like aesthetic

## What Needs to Be Done Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Testing & Refinement)

1. **Test the Application** üéØ PRIORITY
   - [ ] Run `npm start` and test with sample blog content
   - [ ] Verify both landscape and square formats generate correctly
   - [ ] Test with various content lengths (short, medium, long)
   - [ ] Test with HTML content (verify cleaning works)
   - [ ] Test download functionality
   - [ ] Check visual quality at full resolution

2. **Visual Refinement** (if needed after testing)
   - [ ] Adjust color palettes if needed
   - [ ] Fine-tune density/complexity/smoothness mappings
   - [ ] Adjust layer opacity/blend modes if visuals are too busy or too sparse
   - [ ] Consider adding variation to avoid repetitive patterns

3. **Bug Fixes** (if discovered during testing)
   - [ ] Document any issues found
   - [ ] Fix browser compatibility issues
   - [ ] Handle edge cases (empty content, very long content, special characters)

### Future Enhancements (v2)

**Content Analysis:**
- [ ] Integrate NLP library (natural, compromise, or sentiment)
- [ ] Extract keywords and themes
- [ ] Detect sentiment/mood (map to color palettes)
- [ ] Topic detection (map to visual styles)

**Visual Styles:**
- [ ] Add geometric/minimal style option
- [ ] Add data-viz/infographic style option
- [ ] Allow style selection in UI
- [ ] Create style presets

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Add preview with regenerate option
- [ ] Manual parameter controls (color, density, etc.)
- [ ] Save/load favorite configurations
- [ ] Portrait format (1200√ó1500px) for Pinterest

**Automation:**
- [ ] CLI version for batch processing
- [ ] API endpoint for programmatic access
- [ ] Integration with blog platforms (WordPress, Ghost, etc.)

**Polish:**
- [ ] Loading states during generation
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Example gallery with sample outputs
- [ ] Ability to save/share parameters

## How to Continue Development

### Starting the App
```bash
npm start
# Opens at http://localhost:8080
```

### Testing with Sample Content
Use one of your actual blog posts to test. Try:
1. A short post (200-300 words)
2. A medium post (500-800 words)
3. A long post (1000+ words)

### Making Changes

**To adjust visual parameters:**
- Modify mappings in `src/seedGenerator.js:23-51`

**To tweak visuals:**
- Adjust algorithms in `src/visualGenerator.js`
- Color palettes: lines 21-85
- Drawing logic: lines 87-203

**To add new color palettes:**
- Add to `initColorPalettes()` in `src/visualGenerator.js`

**To change output sizes:**
- Modify dimensions in `src/app.js:165` and `app.js:175`

## Questions to Answer in Next Session

1. **Visual Quality:** Do the generated images look good? Are they too busy, too sparse, or just right?

2. **Color Palettes:** Are the 10 palettes sufficient? Do they need adjustment?

3. **Determinism:** Does the same content reliably produce the same image?

4. **Performance:** Does generation feel fast enough? (Should be near-instant)

5. **Use Cases:** Do the generated images work well for your actual blog posts and social media?

6. **Next Priority:** Should we focus on visual refinement, or move towards v2 features like semantic analysis?

## Technical Notes

- **p5.js version:** Using 1.11.2 from CDN
- **Instance mode:** Using p5 instance mode to avoid global namespace pollution
- **Seeding:** Both `randomSeed()` and `noiseSeed()` are set for determinism
- **Download format:** PNG (lossless, good for graphics)
- **No build step:** Currently using vanilla JS, could add Vite/Webpack later if needed

## Success Criteria

The MVP is considered successful if:
- ‚úÖ Application runs without errors
- ‚è≥ Generated images are visually appealing and abstract/organic
- ‚è≥ Same content consistently produces same image
- ‚è≥ Images work well on social media (right size, visual impact)
- ‚è≥ Workflow is smooth (paste ‚Üí generate ‚Üí download)

**Status:** Ready for testing to validate remaining criteria.
